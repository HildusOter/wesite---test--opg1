  <h1>  A Tale of imagination and fire </h1>
 

  
    <h5 > As children we wandered the wilderness. Through bushes and barracks, over dead trees, under rockslides and in the depths of dark caves. And there we found it, our youthful treasure - the world of imagination, animals and magic.</h5>

    <h3> Then we came home with a broken branch. </h3>
    
    <h5>Great kids, our fathers remarked - as we watched our magic wand get torched black and dead in the flames of the furnace.</h5>

    <h3> Is imagination the limit, or what limits our imagination? </h3>

    <h5> This did not stop our wanderlust, as we now set course for abandoned buildings, cyckled through empty parking lots, saw  dowey windowshiekds on a top model Ford, nest to a broken down scary sheds .</h5>

    <h5>Not a step further! Our mother proclaimed as we were about to sneak though the backdoor. The paint soaked pirate outfit from our newly conquered territory got torn into rags in the garden. Perfect for fathers oily sunday underneath the old american car, she said.</h5>
    
    <h3> The affliction of time may change our youthful imagination, but humans everdeveloping creativity is limitless </h3>

    <h5> This is a visual introduction  of somebody who loves the imaginary soul of a child  empowered with wisdom of the elders. The balance of young and old need not harmonize, but produce a synergetic force when combined, and give rise to greater and unexpected mysteries, imagination and creativity.</h5>

    <h3> The smallest things, can create the modt memorable moments. Welcome to my resume. </h3>

    Move boundaries, Create adventure. Imagination is fire. Limits or limitless?
